## Basic dot files configuration

1. Change configs present in config.sh according to your needs.
2. Run install.sh
3. If install.sh fails for some reason, inspect the debug.log and install the relevant dependancy present in the dependancy folder.
3. Run the update_bashrc.sh

Will attach screenshots [WIP]
